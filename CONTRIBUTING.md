# Contributing to Velthoric

Welcome, and thanks for your interest in contributing to **Velthoric**!  
Velthoric is a physics-focused Minecraft project built out of passion for experimenting with game mechanics and engine-like features. While the project primarily exists to support our own goals, we’re happy to see others use, learn from, and contribute to it.

Please understand that Velthoric is not an “enterprise-grade” framework. We value contributions, but our own roadmap and priorities will always come first.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
If you find a bug, crash, or unexpected behavior:
- Open a GitHub issue with as much detail as possible.
- Include steps to reproduce, your environment (MC + Forge/Fabric version), and any logs or screenshots that help us understand the problem.

Feature suggestions are welcome too - just be constructive and specific.

### Pull Requests (PRs)
We gladly accept PRs that align with the project’s direction. To improve the chance of your PR being merged:

1. **Open an Issue First (optional but recommended):** For larger changes, start with a discussion so your work fits with Velthoric’s goals.
2. **Commit Directly to `master`:** Make your commits directly to the `master` branch, and ensure each commit is clear and descriptive.
3. **Follow Coding Style:** Keep formatting and structure consistent with the existing codebase.
4. **Write Clear Commits:** Each commit should be meaningful and explain *what* changed and *why*.
5. **Test Thoroughly:** Make sure your changes don’t break existing features and don’t cause performance regressions.
6. **Keep PRs Focused:** Avoid unrelated changes - small, focused PRs are easier to review and accept.
7. **Submit Against `master`:** All PRs should target the `master` branch.

### Code Reviews
All contributions are reviewed before merging.  
Feedback may include requests for style changes, performance improvements, or clarifications. Please treat reviews as collaboration, not criticism.

## What to Expect
- **Priorities:** Our own use cases take precedence. Not every idea or PR will be accepted, even if technically valid.
- **Response Times:** This is a passion project - we’ll do our best to review in a timely manner, but patience is appreciated.
- **Feedback Loop:** If changes are requested on a PR, please update your branch accordingly.
- **No Guarantees:** Every contribution is valued, but not all contributions will be merged.

## Thank You!
We appreciate your time, effort, and interest in Velthoric.  
Whether you file an issue, fix a bug, or build a new feature - your help makes this project better for everyone.

Happy coding!
