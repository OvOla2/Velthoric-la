# Changelog â€“ Version 0.2.0

## Features
- Implemented 3D Greedy Meshing and removed MeshShape usage
- Added motorcycles and refactored vehicle system
- Added client-side raycasting and seat synchronization
- Implemented allocation-free ZLIB compression for batch packets
- Added data-driven synchronization system with adapters for vanilla and Jolt types
- Precise OBB-based seat selection and seat OBB rendering
- Smooth entity position while riding

## Fixes
- Stop automatic braking when reversing
- Smooth physics body stopping and perpetual visibility
- Add `isClientSide` check to entity rendering mixin
- Resolve dual hitbox issue for mounted entities
- Prevent duplicate object spawn requests
- Prevent physics pause on integrated LAN servers
- Correct various typos in package and class names
- Render BlockEntities correctly and cache them to prevent render-loop allocations

## Refactors & Architecture
- Decouple serialization logic into Codecs
- Overhaul vehicle network synchronization (`VxWheelNetworkDispatcher`, `VxPacketHandler`)
- Modularized rendering pipeline for mounted entities
- Separate debug rendering into `VxDebugRenderer`
- Centralize physics layer logic in `VxLayers`
- Restructure terrain system: switch from meshes to actual block shapes and boxes, improve performance and stability
- Migrate seat identification from names to UUIDs
- Migrate all standard types to data-driven synchronization system
- Add `Vx` prefix to relevant classes

## Performance
- Unified body queries into a single batch
- Optimized dispatcher and fixed update packet race conditions
- Cache BlockEntities to reduce render-loop allocations
- Improved method organization in body classes

## Tuning
- Lower restitution and friction in MarbleRigidBody
- Increase size argument limits from 20 to 200

## Miscellaneous
- Removed unnecessary logs and imports
- Removed test commands and unused classes
- Restructured CONTRIBUTING.md
