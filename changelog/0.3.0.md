# Changelog â€“ Version 0.3.0

## Fixes
- Separated client-only code to prevent `ClassNotFoundException` on dedicated servers.
- Refined buoyancy calculation by averaging fluid surface height for smoother object movement.
- Improved buoyancy broadphase accuracy by iterating over all AABB blocks instead of sampling.
- Fixed a rare `ClassCastException` when growing EMotionType arrays in JNI-bound code.
- Corrected force application to ensure buoyancy acts relative to the center of mass.
- Applied linear drag at the center of buoyancy, improving torque behavior and rotation stability.
- Updated acknowledgments with the correct JoltJNI link and naming conventions.

## Performance
- Refactored the buoyancy system using Structure of Arrays (SoA) and double buffering for better data locality and parallelism.
- Cached body motion types in the data store to eliminate redundant JNI calls per tick.

## Refactors & Architecture
- Overhauled the buoyancy pipeline for more stable and realistic flotation behavior.
- Ensured clean separation between client and server logic to maintain compatibility and prevent runtime issues.

## Miscellaneous
- Polished internal naming and consistency across buoyancy and physics systems.
